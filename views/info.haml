%h1 Personal non-random number picker.
%p This thingy tries to pick numbers that I would pick.
%p It goes through all the text messages I've sent since 2009, and extracts all the numbers. Then, it picks numbers based on how often I've used them in texts.

%h2 
	= @out.length.to_s + (@out.length == 1 ? " Number" : " Numbers")
%ul 
	- @out.each do |number|
		%li= number
